# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a technique to wrap the smaller entitities like instance variables and methods into a bigger entity,  we can also provide restricted access to instance variabls/class variables to achieve data hiding

we can use getters and setter to get and set the values of the private instance variables


## Constructors 

Constructors are nothing but the functions that are used to initialise the objects from a class 

they can be of different types 
1. Default constructor - Takes no variables initialize the variables to their default variables __(0 for int, null for strings etc)__. You don't need to explicitly create it, its there by default.
2. Custom Constructor - This is a type of constructor takes some value as an input and initialize the instance variables with those values  

_note_ - _once you define the parameterized constructor you have to explicitly define the default one as well._


# Inheritance 
in object oriented programming when a class inherits properties and methods from another class
