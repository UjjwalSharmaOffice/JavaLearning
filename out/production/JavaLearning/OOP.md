# Object-Oriented Programming in Java
OOP is a programming technique in which things revolves around classes and objects

classes are nothing but the blueprint of the object that have some properties and methods

properties like - colour, age, price etc
methods like - honks, runs etc


**encapsulation** me you are just wrapping up a smaller entity into a bigger entity named as class and achieving data privacy with the help of access modifiers

in **inheritance** you inherit the properties and methods from the super/parent class

in **polymorphism** when specifically comes to java you can create the `object reference` of `parent` class and the actual object of `child` class it will just use the properties and methods of the child class and if not present there it will move to the respective things in the parent class

in abstraction we hide the implementation details and provides the high level overview of the system
